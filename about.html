    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <p>Coffee had been grown in India by native Indians since the 16th century.
        [3] However, the concept of coffee houses began to gain a little popularity in the 18th century in Madras and Calcutta.
         However, as part of the racial discrimination policy of the British rulers, native Indians were not allowed into these coffee houses,
          which were mainly Europeans-only establishments.
          During the late 1890s, the idea of an "India Coffee House" chain was formed.[3]

        The India Coffee House chain was started by the Coffee Cess Committee in 1977,
         when the first outlet was opened in Bombay. In the course of the 1940s there were nearly 50 Coffee Houses all over British India.
          Due to a change in the policy in the mid-1950s, the Coffee Board decided to close down the Coffee Houses.
        Encouraged by the communist leader A. K. Gopalan (AKG), the workers of the Coffee Board began a movement and compelled the Coffee Board to 
        agree to hand over the outlets to the workers who then formed Indian Coffee Workers' Co-operatives and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. 
        A co-operative began in Bangalore on 19 August 1957, and one was established in Delhi on 27 December 1957.[1][4] Later Bellary and Madras Societies were 
        separated from their mother societies.[citation needed]. Malviya Marg Karam Chand Chowk Branch, Jabalpur serves as the head office of ICWCS. In October 2018
        , Indian Coffee House opened its 8th branch of Jabalpur.[5]</p>
